##Short Version
Music Blocks is a fork of [Turtle Blocks](https://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs), It has extensions for exploring music: pitch and rhythm. It can be used to learn the basics of the music and music programming. It is used widely students as well as the teachers. To start exploring it you can download it from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/walterbender/musicblocks) by cloning it. (To learn how to do that, you can watch the [MusicBlocks Git Clone video](https://goblinrefuge.com/mediagoblin/u/pikurasa/m/music-blocks-software-on-your-computer-with-git/)).

So how can I use Music Blocks? Well for me the question was what struck my mind first when I looked at the activity, but the best way to find out the answer to that is to start exploring it. I downloaded the activity and learnt how to use it, found some interesting people on the IRC who helped me when I was stuck. For me, Music Blocks is a fun way to learn more about music. It helps me keep up with my curiosity for learning musical instruments like guitar.

I am a programmer and have been working for Sugar in Google Code In 2015, so as part of that I contributed in the activity by making some changes to header icons, making the video demonstration for beginners helping them to get started, and currently I am working on documenting my experience. If you look at it from a programmer's perspective, looking forward to contribute in it. I am pretty sure that you will find yourself a nice spot where you can fit in and help the activity get better. No matter whether you are a hard core Python programmer or a JS guru or even a front end developer. What's more!? You get to play around and have some music other than the rattling sound of your keys. 

I tried playing around and here is the outcome of it: `Summary of my review`: Overall I think that MusicBlocks is a very nice activity, it is a great addition to the library of the activities of Sugar. It can be used to teach music and for self-learning as well. Though it includes a lot of advanced features, I personally feel that it could use some improvements in the User Interface, because it seems to have been made from a programmer's and a musician's perspective but not so much as from the perspective of an inquisitive learner who does not know much about music and not so much experienced with Turtle Blocks or the palettes. That would be me in this case. So being that person, I can suggest some changes that I think could be helpful to others like me. When poking around the activity I could spot some things that need a bit more love and care added in their interface. For example, there should be a scroll visible in the left bar and the right bar should initially be visible so that people know that it exists. And I found out that while loading the templates, they overflowed so much that it was getting difficult to reach the main screen as the new templates kept changing the position of where I was on the page. Some of the header icons I feel should be made more intuitive. And also I could not find much video tutorials about it. So it might be really helpful for the community to have a bunch of detailed video lectures on small-small features and details of the activity.
Reading and going through the manual and README file, was a real help as it has been nicely documented with photos so that the newcomers and get a hang of what is going on :)
