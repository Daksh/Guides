#Website Evaluation

###Things I love about this website
* How the icon color changes each time one refreshes the page

##Things I think should be added
* The favicon, that is the icon image seen in the tab, has a white background. I think that should be changed to one without a background
Something like:
<img src="\images\favicon.ico"></img>
