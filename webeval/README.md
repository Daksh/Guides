#Website Evaluation

##Things I love about this website
* How the icon color changes each time one refreshes the page
* The animation when you hover over a button
* The website is fast and responsive
* It is made with github pages and jekyll


##Things I think should be added
* The favicon, that is the icon image seen in the tab, has a white background. I think that should be changed to one without a background
Something like icon, save it to see that it does not have a background :D :

<img src="\images\favicon.ico"></img>

##Things which I think should be changed/fixed
* The website does not utilize the screen sapce appropriately
