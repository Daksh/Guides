#Website Evaluation

#www.sugarlabs.org
##Things I love about this website
* How the icon color changes each time one refreshes the page
* The animation when you hover over a button
* The website is fast and responsive
* It is made with github pages and jekyll


##Things I think should be added
* The favicon, that is the icon image seen in the tab, has a white background. I think that should be changed to one without a background
Something like icon, save it to see that it does not have a background :D :

<img src="\images\favicon.ico"></img>

* A slideshow, which shows the worldwise use of the Sugar Systems, XOs.

##Things which I think should be changed/fixed
* The website does not utilize the screen sapce appropriately

<img src="\images\freespaces.png"></img>

* The look and feel, I think should be changed form the plain simple one, to something more attractive for the user. Something like the [Sugar Labs Google Code In 2015 website](daksh.github.io/SugarLabsGCI2015/) or the [FOSSASIA's org website](http://fossasia.org/)

<img src="\images\activitiespage.png"></img>

* The activities pages like the [above one](https://activities-2.sugarlabs.org/view/org.sugarlabs.MazeWebActivity) are opened directly from within the website. The layout is quite similar, so at first it seemed that it was the same website, but the problem with that was that their were minor changes like the background color. I feel that this must be made more consistent by either keeping the same scheme of colors and looks OR change it to look different. Also, there should be added more content to those pages.

* About that page, at least the description from the [activities.sugarlabs page](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4727) and along with the thumbnail. Also, the download image seems too big, and looks like the ones in the spam which come up, (no offence) but I think it should be more embedded into the page along with the theme.

#wiki.sugarlabs.org

It is like the most of the wiki pages, which is a really nice thing. As that increases familiarity for the user and also increases productivity, as one does not need to find features here if they are already accustomed with a media wiki or wikipedia website.

##Things I think should be fixed

<img src="\images\leftsidebar.png"></img>

* The left panel shows a huge list of a number of languages under the topic "Google translations", the problem is that the list is so big, that when there is not much content on the screen, the scroll still goes till the bottom when all you see is the left panel and nothing else. I think that this should be fixed by adding a separate scroll to that sidebar

* [List of uploaded files](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Special:ListFiles) link should be added in the left side bar, currently one can access the link from the [upload file](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Special:Upload) page or the [Special Pages](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Special:SpecialPages) page but, I feel that it should be made more accessible.

* The edit button shown in the image

<img src="\images\editbtn.png"></img>

does not work, and gives the following error:

<img src="\images\editerror.png"></img>

Though I am not sure what it is for, but I think that the <kbd>Edit Source</kbd>kbd> already does the work. So maybe the <kbd>Edit</kbd> button should be removed and the <kbd>Edit Source</kbd> be renamed.
